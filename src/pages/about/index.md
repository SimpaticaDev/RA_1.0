**Charging an electric van**

There are a number of ways to charge an electric van:

* **Public charging stations:** Public charging stations are located in a variety of places, including car parks, shopping centres, and motorway service stations. Public chargers are typically faster than home chargers, but they can also be more expensive.
* **Home chargers:** Home chargers can be installed at your home or business. Home chargers are typically slower than public chargers, but they are also more convenient and affordable.
* **Workplace chargers:** Many workplaces are now installing electric vehicle charging points for their employees. Workplace chargers are typically free to use, and they can be a convenient way to charge your electric van while you are at work.

To charge your electric van at a public charging station, you will need to use a charging cable. Most public charging stations provide charging cables, but it is a good idea to have a cable as a backup. 

If you have a charger at home - you can charge your van at home.

To find a public charging station, you can use a number of different apps and websites, such as Zap-Map and Pod Point. These apps and websites will show you the location of public charging stations, as well as their availability and charging speed.

There are a few different types of chargers for electric vans in the UK:

* **Slow chargers:** Slow chargers are typically rated at 3kW or 7kW. They are the most common type of charger, and they can be found at homes and businesses. Slow chargers take the longest to charge an electric van, but they are also the most affordable.
* **Fast chargers:** Fast chargers are typically rated at 22kW or 50kW. They are faster than slow chargers, but they are also more expensive. Fast chargers are typically found at public charging stations.
* **Rapid chargers:** Rapid chargers are the fastest type of charger, and they are typically rated at 100kW or 350kW. Rapid chargers can charge an electric van in as little as 30 minutes. Rapid chargers are typically found at motorway service stations.

The type of charger you need will depend on your needs. If you are able to charge your van at home or work overnight, then a slow charger may be sufficient. If you need to charge your van quickly, then you will need to use a fast or rapid charger.
