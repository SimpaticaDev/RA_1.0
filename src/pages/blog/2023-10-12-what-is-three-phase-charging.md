title: What is Three-phase charging?
date: 2023-10-12T17:12:20.406Z
description: Three-phase charging is a type of electric vehicle (EV) charging
  that uses three phases of electrical power to charge the EV's battery. This
  results in faster charging speeds than single-phase charging, which uses only
  one phase of electrical power.

Three-phase charging is typically available at commercial and industrial locations, but it is also becoming increasingly available at public charging stations. To use three-phase charging, you will need an EV that is compatible with three-phase charging and a three-phase charging station.

The benefits of three-phase charging include:

* Faster charging speeds: Three-phase charging can charge an EV up to three times faster than single-phase charging.
* Reduced charging costs: Three-phase charging can help to reduce charging costs by allowing you to charge your EV during off-peak hours.
* Increased flexibility: Three-phase charging gives you more flexibility in terms of where you can charge your EV.

The drawbacks of three-phase charging include:

* Higher upfront cost: Three-phase charging stations are typically more expensive than single-phase charging stations.
* Limited availability: Three-phase charging stations are not as widely available as single-phase charging stations.
* Compatibility issues: Not all EVs are compatible with three-phase charging.

Overall, three-phase charging is a good option for businesses, fleets, and individuals who need to charge their EVs quickly and who have access to three-phase electrical power. However, it is important to weigh the benefits and drawbacks of three-phase charging before making a decision.
